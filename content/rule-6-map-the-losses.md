## The Story

In early 2025, researchers published a study in the *International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being* that followed 24 IT professionals who had experienced AI-induced job loss or reassignment. What they found wasn't resistance. It was grief.

Participants described **"a persistent state of worry that did not switch off, even at night."** They talked about **"checking LinkedIn with a sense of dread."** The researchers applied Rando's anticipatory grief framework — the same framework used for terminal illness — and found it fit. These professionals were mourning **"not just what they had lost but what they feared would never come back."**

This isn't an edge case. The EY AI Anxiety in Business Survey found that **75% of employees are concerned AI will make certain jobs obsolete** and **65% are anxious about AI replacing their specific job**. Nearly half (48%) say they're more concerned than they were a year ago.

Academic research has identified **"AI identity threat"** as a measurable phenomenon: the fear that AI will change not just what you do, but who you are. Three central predictors: changes to work, loss of status, and threats to professional identity. When your expertise was hard-won over years or decades, and a machine can approximate it in seconds, the threat isn't to your productivity. It's to your *self*.

This explains why Prosci found that **user proficiency is the #1 AI challenge** (38% of all reported difficulties) while technical issues account for only 16%. People aren't struggling with the technology. They're struggling with what the technology means for them.

And it explains why BCG found that **70% of AI implementation challenges are people- and process-related**. The algorithms work. The people hurt.

## The Science

**Bridges' Transitions Model** says every transition begins with an **Ending**. Before people can embrace the new beginning, they must acknowledge and process what they're losing. Skip the Ending phase and you get stuck: people pretend to adopt while secretly mourning and resisting.

In AI transitions, the losses are real:
- Loss of **expertise value** — "I spent years learning this, and now AI does it."
- Loss of **status** — "My role was important because of what I knew."
- Loss of **certainty** — "I can't predict what my job will look like."
- Loss of **community** — "My team is being restructured."

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Name the losses out loud.** In your next team meeting, say: "AI is going to change how we work. Before we talk about what we're gaining, let's talk about what we're losing." Give people space to name it. Write it on a whiteboard. Don't argue with it or fix it.

2. **Run a Loss Mapping session.** Use the three-column tool:
   - Column 1: What are we losing? (skills, roles, processes, status, certainty)
   - Column 2: What does that loss mean to us? (identity, livelihood, community)
   - Column 3: What can we carry forward? (not everything is lost — what translates?)

3. **Validate before you solve.** The single biggest mistake in AI change management is jumping to solutions before validating the loss. "I hear that you're worried about your expertise becoming irrelevant. That's a real concern. Let's talk about what expertise means in an AI-augmented world." That's different from: "Don't worry, AI won't replace you."

### Part A: Three-Column Loss Map

**Instructions:** As a team, fill in each column honestly.

| What Are We Losing? | What Does That Loss Mean? | What Can We Carry Forward? |
|---|---|---|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Common AI-related losses to prompt discussion:**
- Manual skills we spent years developing
- The role of "the expert who knows how"
- Predictability of our daily work
- Certain job functions or responsibilities
- Team structures and reporting lines
- Professional identity ("I'm a ___ ")
