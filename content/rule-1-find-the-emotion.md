## The Story

In January 2025, McKinsey published what would become the most cited AI adoption report of the year: "Superagency in the Workplace." The headline number — 92% of companies planning AI investment, only 1% seeing real results — made the rounds. But the more interesting finding was buried deeper.

When researchers asked C-suite executives how many of their employees were using generative AI for more than a third of their daily work, the average answer was 4%. When they asked the employees themselves, the answer was 13%.

**Employees are using AI three times more than their leaders think.**

That same year, BCG and Harvard Business Review surveyed 1,400 U.S.-based employees. They found that 76% of executives believed their employees were enthusiastic about AI adoption. The actual enthusiasm rate among individual contributors? Thirty-one percent.

Leaders are not just wrong about the numbers. They are wrong about the *feelings*.

McKinsey's same report classified employees into four archetypes based on their **emotional posture** toward AI: 39% are **Bloomers** (optimists), 37% are **Gloomers** (skeptics), 20% are **Zoomers** (fast deployers), and 4% are **Doomers** (rejecters). Here's the striking part: even among the skeptics, **94% of Gloomers and 71% of Doomers are familiar with GenAI tools.** The gap isn't knowledge. It's feeling.

Here is what the research actually shows about how employees feel:
- **75% are concerned** AI will make certain jobs obsolete (EY, 2023).
- **65% are anxious** about AI replacing their job specifically.
- **48% are more concerned** about AI today than they were a year ago.
- Researchers have documented **anticipatory grief** — IT professionals who faced AI-induced reassignment described "a persistent state of worry that did not switch off, even at night" and "checking LinkedIn with a sense of dread."
- PwC surveyed 49,843 workers globally and found that entry-level workers hold **fear and curiosity simultaneously** — nearly a third worried, yet 47% also curious. Leaders must speak to both.

The two gaps — strategy-execution and leader-employee — are not information gaps. They are **emotion gaps**. Leaders believe in AI because they see the strategy. Employees fear AI because they feel the threat.

No amount of rational explanation about productivity gains will close an emotion gap. Only emotion closes an emotion gap.

## The Science

The Heath brothers' **Switch** framework distinguishes between the Rider (rational mind) and the Elephant (emotional mind). The Rider can plan and analyze. But the Elephant — the emotional system — is what actually moves. If the Elephant doesn't want to go, the Rider can pull the reins all day and nothing happens.

Most AI rollouts appeal exclusively to the Rider: ROI projections, productivity metrics, strategic rationale. Meanwhile the Elephant — the 65% who are anxious, the people grieving their professional identity — stands still.

The **DxGxFxP formula** (Dissatisfaction x Goals x First Steps must exceed the Pain of change) makes the same point differently. If people don't feel dissatisfaction with the current state — or if the pain of changing feels larger than the pain of staying — they won't move. The formula is multiplicative: if any factor is zero, the product is zero.

**The move**: Before you explain *what* AI does, you must make people *feel* why the current state is unsustainable. Not with data. With story.

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Find your "Two Futures" moment.** At your next team meeting, don't present AI strategy. Instead, present two futures: one where your team/company adopts AI well, and one where it doesn't. Make them vivid. Make them specific to your people's actual work. What do their jobs look like in each future? What does the company look like?

   Here's an example for a marketing team:

   > **Future A — We adopted AI well:**
   > "It's 18 months from now. Our team produces campaigns in days, not weeks. Junior copywriters use AI to generate first drafts and spend their time on creative direction — the work they actually went to school for. Our data analyst runs queries in natural language and presents insights the same afternoon the CMO asks for them. We hired two new people this year — not to replace roles AI eliminated, but for roles that didn't exist before: an AI workflow designer and a prompt strategist. People joke that they couldn't imagine going back. Our competitors are still writing briefs the old way."
   >
   > **Future B — We didn't adopt AI:**
   > "It's 18 months from now. Three of our best copywriters left for companies where they get to work with AI tools — they said they felt like they were falling behind. Our campaign timelines haven't changed, but our competitors' have: they're producing twice the content in half the time, and it shows in their market share. The team feels stuck. People whisper about layoffs, not because they're happening, but because they know eventually the company will need to catch up — and catching up usually means cutting. The mood is anxious. The best people are updating their resumes."

   Notice: no slides. No charts. Two paragraphs that make your stomach turn — one with hope, one with dread. That's an Elephant argument.

2. **Surface the real feelings.** Before any AI initiative, run an anonymous survey with these three questions:
   - How do you feel about AI changing your work? (1-5 scale + open text)
   - What excites you most about AI at work?
   - What worries you most about AI at work?

   You will be surprised. Leaders almost always overestimate excitement and underestimate fear.

3. **Lead with the stat that stings.** Find the one number in your industry that makes the status quo feel dangerous. Not "AI will increase productivity by 20%." That's a Rider argument. Something like: "Our competitors are already using AI to do in 2 minutes what takes us 11." That's an Elephant argument.

## Worksheet 1: "Two Futures" Writing Exercise

**Instructions:** Write two short paragraphs (3-5 sentences each) describing your team or company in 18 months.

**Future A — We adopted AI well:**

_What does daily work look like? What have we achieved? How do people feel about their work?_

> _______________________________________________________________
> _______________________________________________________________
> _______________________________________________________________
> _______________________________________________________________

**Future B — We didn't adopt AI (or adopted it poorly):**

_What does daily work look like? What have we lost? How do people feel?_

> _______________________________________________________________
> _______________________________________________________________
> _______________________________________________________________
> _______________________________________________________________

**Here's an example to get you started — adapt it for your team's reality:**

| | Future A (AI adopted well) | Future B (AI not adopted) |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily work** | First drafts take minutes; people focus on judgment and refinement | Same manual processes; people feel like they're running in place |
| **Team morale** | Energy is high; people feel like they're learning and growing | Anxiety is rising; best people are looking at other companies |
| **Competitive position** | Ahead of peers; clients notice the speed and quality | Falling behind; competitors deliver faster and clients are asking why we don't |
| **Talent** | Attracting curious people who want to work with modern tools | Losing curious people who are bored with legacy workflows |

**Now answer:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Which future feels more likely right now? | |
| What is the single biggest emotion your team would feel reading Future B? | |
| What is one story or example you could share to make Future A feel real? | |
| What is the "stat that stings" for your industry? | |
