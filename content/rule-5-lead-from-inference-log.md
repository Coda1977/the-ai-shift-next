## The Story

Airtable CEO Howie Liu doesn't just talk about AI. He uses it hourly. And he can prove it.

> *"I'm the number one most expensive inference-cost user of Airtable AI — not just within our company but globally across all our customers as well."*

Liu didn't become an "AI-forward CEO" by issuing memos. He became one by spending hundreds of dollars on inference costs in single experiments, by blocking out entire days to test new AI products, and by coding daily in what he calls the **"IC CEO" model** — the Individual Contributor CEO.

When he tells his team *"If anyone wants to literally block out a day or frankly even a week and cancel all your meetings to play around with every AI product you can find — go do it, period"* — they believe him. Because he does it himself.

Tobi Lutke at Shopify took the same approach from a policy direction: *"This applies to all of us — including me and the executive team."* AI usage isn't something leaders mandate for others. It's something leaders demonstrate first.

The data makes the stakes clear. BCG's 2025 research found that when leaders demonstrate strong support for AI, the share of employees who feel positive about GenAI rises from **15% to 55%**. That's not a marginal improvement. That's a 3.7X multiplier from leadership behavior alone.

PwC's 2025 Global Workforce survey (49,843 workers, 48 countries) found that **daily GenAI users report productivity gains at a 92% rate** — compared to 58% among infrequent users. Daily users also report higher job security (58% vs. 36%) and higher pay (52% vs. 32%). Frequency of use is the variable that changes everything. And that variable starts at the top.

But here's the uncomfortable truth: only about **25% of frontline employees** report receiving that strong leadership support. Three out of four CEOs are leading without a defined AI roadmap. And 63% of employees attribute leadership's reluctance to adopt AI to **"digital illiteracy."**

The employees see it. They know when a leader can't use the tools they're mandating.

## The Science

**Bridges' Transitions Model** adds another layer. Bridges distinguishes between *change* (the external event) and *transition* (the internal psychological process). Leaders who haven't gone through their own AI transition — who haven't felt the discomfort of learning new tools, the frustration of bad outputs, the excitement of a breakthrough prompt — cannot guide others through theirs.

The inference log is the ultimate proof of transition. It's not a statement of intent. It's a record of behavior.

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Start your 30-Day Leader Immersion.** For 30 days, use AI for at least one significant work task per day. Not delegated to an assistant. You, personally. Keep a log. Share it with your team at the end.

2. **Make your usage visible.** Share your AI wins *and failures* with your team in weekly check-ins. "I tried using Claude for X this week. Here's what worked. Here's what didn't." This does two things: models the behavior and normalizes the learning curve.

3. **Measure your own usage.** Can you quantify your AI usage? Howie Liu can — in inference costs. You might measure it in sessions per week, tasks completed with AI, or hours saved. If you can't measure your own usage, you can't credibly ask others to increase theirs.

4. **Ask the uncomfortable question.** In your next leadership team meeting, ask each leader: "How many times did you personally use an AI tool this week? Not your team. You." The silence will tell you everything.
