## The Story

Kurt Lewin's famous change model has three stages: Unfreeze → Change → Refreeze. It was published in 1947. For 78 years, change management practitioners have used it as gospel: destabilize the current state, implement the new state, stabilize again.

AI breaks the model.

Consider the pace: GPT-3 was released in June 2020. GPT-4 in March 2023. By early 2025, we had multimodal models, coding assistants, autonomous agents, and AI systems that could reason through multi-step problems. Every quarter brings a capability that was impossible the quarter before. The AI tool your team standardized on six months ago may already be the wrong choice. The workflow you optimized in January may be obsolete by June.

**Every AI workflow you implement today will need to be rebuilt within 18 months. That's not a problem. That's the design constraint.**

Prosci's research on AI-driven change puts it directly: *"Traditional change management operates on defined phases with clear endpoints. AI adoption breaks this model. The technology evolves rapidly, new capabilities emerge constantly, and organizations must adapt their implementations in real-time."*

Shopify's headcount went from 11,600 to 8,100 — but the memo didn't say "and now we're done." It said AI usage is a **baseline expectation**. Permanently. The change isn't an event. It's a condition. Lutke said it plainly: *"Reflexively adding headcount to solve problems before using what we already have at our disposal — especially AI — will be something we need to explain."* That's not a one-time restructuring. It's a permanent operating principle.

Zapier didn't reach 97% and stop. They created a **Chief People & AI Transformation Officer** — a permanent executive role dedicated to continuous AI evolution. Their tolerance for "duplication" and failed experiments isn't a phase. It's a design principle. When asked about their approach, Zapier's leadership emphasized that they deliberately allow multiple teams to solve similar problems independently, because the learning is more valuable than the efficiency.

Airtable's Howie Liu says every software product must be **"refounded"** — not once, but continuously. He restructured the company into "fast thinking" and "slow thinking" groups specifically because AI requires different speeds of change simultaneously. The fast group experiments and ships rapidly. The slow group integrates changes into the core product. Neither group is ever "done."

Klarna learned that even successful AI deployment requires continuous adaptation. Their AI assistant was a triumph in month one and a customer satisfaction problem in month six. They had to reverse course, move to a hybrid model, and keep adjusting. The company that everyone cited as the AI success story had to publicly admit it went too far, recalibrate, and keep evolving. The destination keeps moving.

The companies that try to refreeze pay the price. They standardize on a single AI tool — then a better one emerges. They train everyone on a specific workflow — then the model update changes everything. They write an AI policy — then new capabilities make the policy irrelevant. Every time they try to solidify, the ground shifts.

The data confirms this is the new normal:
- Only **1%** of companies say their AI adoption is delivering real results. The other 99% are still changing.
- **85%** of companies expect to customize AI agents (Deloitte) — a capability that didn't exist two years ago.
- BCG found the gap between AI leaders and laggards is **widening**, not closing. Standing still means falling behind.
- New AI capabilities are emerging **every quarter** — multimodal reasoning, autonomous agents, real-time voice, computer use. Each one requires new workflows, new policies, new skills.

The organizations that succeed aren't the ones that change once. They're the ones that build the capacity to change continuously.

## The Science

**Lewin's model, subverted**: The insight isn't that Lewin was wrong. It's that the "refreeze" stage no longer applies to AI. In a world where AI capabilities shift every quarter, any frozen state becomes obsolete before the ice hardens. The new model is: Unfreeze → Change → Change → Change. Permanent thaw.

**Schabracq's Radical Change** framework describes environments of continuous disruption where traditional stability-seeking strategies fail. In these environments, the goal isn't to reach a new equilibrium. It's to build **adaptive capacity** — the organizational muscle to change continuously without breaking. The companies in this booklet — Shopify, Zapier, Airtable — aren't succeeding because they found the right AI strategy. They're succeeding because they built organizations that can absorb continuous change.

**Kotter's "anchor in culture"** (Step 8) needs updating for AI: don't anchor a specific AI practice into culture. Anchor the *practice of continuous adaptation* into culture. The habit isn't "use ChatGPT." The habit is "every quarter, we reassess how AI is changing our work and we adapt."

**Reinforcement** in Prosci's ADKAR model becomes *"an active process of continuous readiness rather than a finite goal."*

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Schedule quarterly AI retrospectives.** Every 90 days, your team asks:
   - What AI tools have we adopted since the last retro?
   - What new capabilities have become available?
   - What should we start, stop, or change?
   - Who's our most improved AI user? What can we learn from them?
   - What did we standardize on that's already outdated?

2. **Build a "permanent thaw" infrastructure:**
   - A living Green Light List (updated monthly, not annually).
   - A Pathfinder program that refreshes every quarter with new people and new tools.
   - AI training embedded in onboarding (not a one-time workshop).
   - An AI metrics dashboard that's reviewed weekly.
   - A dedicated owner (person or team) for AI change management — like Zapier's CPAITO role.

3. **Create role evolution conversations.** Every 6 months, each team member should discuss with their manager: "How has AI changed my role? How will it change in the next 6 months? What new skills do I need?" This normalizes continuous adaptation and prevents the shock of sudden change.

4. **Stop saying "transformation."** Transformation implies a start and end point. Replace it with **"evolution"**: "Our AI evolution continues." This linguistic shift signals to the organization that change is permanent, expected, and healthy.

5. **Budget for obsolescence.** Assume that 30% of your current AI tools and workflows will need replacing each year. Build that into your planning. Companies that budget for stability get disrupted. Companies that budget for change stay ahead.

6. **Make "What changed?" a standing agenda item.** Every team meeting, every leadership sync, every all-hands: "What's new in AI since we last met? What does it mean for us?" When the question is routine, adaptation becomes routine.
