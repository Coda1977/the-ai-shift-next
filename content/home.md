## The Two Gaps

There are two numbers that define the current moment in AI adoption. Both are shocking. Neither is about technology.

**Gap 1: Strategy vs. Execution**

Ninety-two percent of companies plan to invest more in AI. One percent say their AI adoption is delivering real results. That's not a pipeline problem. That's not a technology problem. That is a change management problem — a 91-point gap between intention and reality.

**Gap 2: Leaders vs. Employees**

Leaders estimate that 4% of their employees use generative AI for more than a third of their work. Employees self-report 13%. Employees are using AI **three times more** than their leaders think. And 47% of employees expect to be using AI for a third or more of their daily tasks within a year — compared to only 20% of executives.

The leaders are behind. The employees are ahead. And nobody is talking to each other.

> *"76% of executives believe their employees feel enthusiastic about AI. Only 31% of individual contributors agree."*
> — HBR / BCG, November 2025

Here is what these two gaps tell us: the barrier to AI adoption is not the technology. It's not the budget. It's not the algorithm. **It's the change.**

Seventy percent of AI implementation challenges are people- and process-related. Only 10% involve the AI algorithms themselves. The companies that win the AI era will not be the ones with the best models. They will be the ones that manage the human transition best.

**This is a change management booklet, not a technology booklet.**

If you're looking for which AI tools to buy, this isn't for you. If you're looking for how to get your people to actually use them — how to lead the shift that's already happening whether you manage it or not — read on.
