## The Story

On April 7, 2025, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke published an internal memo on X. The title was blunt: **"AI usage is now a baseline expectation."**

The core policy: teams must prove AI *cannot* do the job before requesting additional headcount or resources. Not "consider using AI." Not "we encourage AI adoption." You must **demonstrate** that AI can't do it first.

Lutke went further:
- Every team must ask: *"What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?"*
- Prototyping must be **"dominated"** by AI exploration.
- AI usage added to **performance reviews and peer review questionnaires**.
- "This applies to all of us — including me and the executive team."

And the line that made it a change management case study, not just a tech memo:

> *"Frankly, I don't think it's feasible to opt out of learning the skill of applying AI in your craft; you are welcome to try, but I want to be honest, I cannot see this working out today, and definitely not tomorrow."*

The result? Shopify's headcount went from 11,600 in 2022 to 8,100 in 2024 — while growing revenue 21%+ annually. AI didn't replace people. AI became the starting point, and the organization reshaped around it.

GitHub took a different path to the same destination. Their philosophy: **"It's a bug if you have to change the way you code when using GitHub Copilot."** They didn't ask developers to learn a new tool. They embedded AI into the tool developers already use. The result: developers code 55% faster, and 74% report reduced frustration and more meaningful work.

## The Science

Behavioral economist Richard Thaler's **Nudge** framework demonstrates that **defaults are the most powerful behavior-shaping tool available**. In organ donation, countries with opt-out systems have donation rates of 85-99%. Countries with opt-in systems: 4-27%. Same decision. Different default. Massively different outcome.

When AI is opt-in — "here's a tool, try it if you want" — adoption follows the opt-in pattern. A few enthusiasts adopt. Most don't. The numbers stay low. Leaders wonder why nobody's using the tools they bought.

When AI is opt-out — "this is how we work now, tell us if you need an exception" — adoption follows the opt-out pattern. Most people use it. A few opt out for specific reasons. The numbers go up.

The **Switch** framework calls this **shaping the path**: change the environment so the desired behavior is easier than the alternative. Don't ask the Elephant to walk uphill. Move the road.

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Audit your current defaults.** List the 5-10 most common workflows on your team. For each one, ask: "Is AI the starting point or an optional add-on?" If it's optional, it's opt-in. People won't opt in.

2. **Flip one default this week.** Pick one workflow where AI can be the starting point. Examples:
   - Meeting notes: AI transcription + summary is the default. Opt out if you want manual notes.
   - First drafts: AI-generated draft is the starting point. Edit from there.
   - Code review: AI review runs automatically. Human review adds to it.
   - Data analysis: AI generates the initial analysis. Humans refine.

3. **Add AI to performance conversations.** Shopify added AI usage to peer review questionnaires. You don't need a company-wide policy to start. Add one question to your next 1:1: *"How are you using AI in your work this week?"*

## Worksheet 2: "Default Audit" Workflow Table

**Instructions:** List your team's 5 most common workflows. Assess the current AI default status and design the new default.

| # | Workflow | Current Default | AI Status | New Default Design | Owner | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | Manual / AI opt-in / AI default | Not available / Available, not used / Used by some / Default | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | | |

**Scoring:**
- "Not available" = 0 points
- "Available, not used" = 1 point
- "Used by some" = 2 points
- "Default" = 3 points

**Your Default Score: ___ / 15**

| Score | Assessment |
|---|---|
| 0-5 | AI is invisible. Your team is opt-in. Expect low adoption. |
| 6-10 | AI exists but isn't the path of least resistance. Flip the defaults. |
| 11-15 | AI is the starting point. You're building the right habits. |
