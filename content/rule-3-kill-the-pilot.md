## The Story

Here's what usually happens with AI in large organizations:

A team gets excited. They propose a pilot. Leadership says "great, run a proof of concept." The pilot works in a controlled environment. A deck is made. Results are presented. Leadership says "interesting, let's think about scaling." Six months later, another team runs another pilot. The first one quietly dies.

MIT's Project NANDA studied this pattern — 150 interviews, 350 employee surveys, 300 public AI deployments — and found the number: **95% of enterprise AI pilots deliver zero measurable return.** American enterprises spent an estimated $40 billion on AI in 2024. Ninety-five percent saw zero bottom-line impact. By 2025, 42% of companies had scrapped most of their AI initiatives entirely, up from 17% the year before.

This is the story of the 92% vs. 1% gap. Over 18 months after the surge in GenAI adoption, only 1% of business leaders say their AI adoption is delivering real results. Most organizations are, in McKinsey's words, "still stitching together pilots, proofs, and scattered automations."

BCG's data reinforces it: **74% of companies can't move beyond proofs of concept.** RAND Corporation found that AI projects fail at **twice the rate** of non-AI IT projects. And here's the kicker — the companies that do succeed pursue **half as many** AI initiatives as their less mature peers. Leaders aren't doing more pilots. They're doing fewer things, but actually scaling them.

The failure cases are vivid. Volkswagen's Cariad division attempted a "big bang" AI transformation across 12 brands simultaneously — and produced a 20-million-line buggy codebase, delayed vehicle launches by over a year, and required 1,600 job cuts. McDonald's invested millions in AI-powered drive-thrus that misheard orders so badly the initiative was quietly shut down. IBM Watson Health at MD Anderson never reached production use, running over budget and failing to integrate into clinical workflows. The common thread: "Instead of starting small and iterating, they went for a 'big bang' transformation."

So the big bang fails. And the pilot fails. **What works?**

Zapier didn't run a pilot. They declared "Code Red" and gave every team permission to figure out AI on their own terms — not as a contained experiment, but as an urgent, distributed push. Support tried AI for ticket triage. Comms tried AI for drafting. Engineering tried AI for code review. Each team ran small, fast experiments on their own terms. The ones that worked spread organically. The ones that didn't were quietly dropped. Adoption went from 63% to 77% to 97%. Not through a single pilot. Through hundreds of Tuesdays.

Shopify's prototyping mandate works the same way. Lutke didn't say "run a pilot." He said prototyping should be "dominated" by AI exploration. A prototype is a Tuesday afternoon thing. Something you try and iterate on. If it works, it becomes Wednesday's default.

GitHub Copilot's growth followed the same arc. It started as a code suggestion tool — one feature, one workflow. Developers tried it on a Tuesday. They liked it. They tried it again on Wednesday. By Friday, it was habit. By month two, they couldn't imagine working without it. The expansion to $2 billion happened one Tuesday at a time.

The critical distinction is this:

| | The Pilot | The Tuesday Experiment |
|---|---|---|
| **Size** | Small | Small |
| **Timeline** | Open-ended | 1 week max |
| **Decision point** | "Let's think about scaling" | Scale or kill by Friday |
| **Design** | Contained, reversible | Expandable, designed to spread |
| **Goal** | Prove the concept | Create the first wave |
| **Failure mode** | Quiet death, no learning | Fast learning, try next thing |

Both are small. That's not the difference. The difference is intent. A pilot is designed to contain. An experiment is designed to expand.

Klarna's story shows what happens when you skip the experiment and go straight to scale. They deployed an AI assistant that handled 2.3 million conversations in its first month — equivalent to 700 full-time agents. Resolution time dropped from 11 minutes to 2 minutes. But customer satisfaction fell sharply. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski publicly acknowledged the company had "sacrificed customer satisfaction in pursuit of short-term efficiency." They had to rehire human agents and move to a hybrid model.

The lesson isn't "don't scale." The lesson is: **kill the pilot, start the experiment, and scale what works — not what you hope works.**

## The Science

**Lewin's Change Model** says change requires three stages: Unfreeze → Change → Refreeze. Pilots get stuck because they never fully unfreeze the organization. A pilot is, by definition, contained. It doesn't challenge the status quo. It runs alongside it. When the pilot ends, the organization refreezes exactly where it was.

**Tipping Point Leadership** (W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne) argues that the way to break through organizational inertia is not to convince everyone gradually. It's to concentrate resources on the few factors that have disproportionate influence. Find the tipping points — the moments, the people, the processes that, once shifted, cascade through the system.

The original case: When Bill Bratton became NYPD commissioner, he didn't try to reform the entire department at once. He identified that transit crime was the tipping point — visible, affecting every New Yorker's daily commute, and solvable. He concentrated resources on subway crime, made precinct commanders ride the subway to see the problem firsthand, and within months, overall NYC crime began to drop. He didn't pilot a crime-reduction initiative. He concentrated force on the highest-leverage point and let it cascade.

In AI terms: Zapier's "Code Red" declaration concentrated urgency across the entire organization — not contained in one team but felt everywhere. JPMorgan's LLM Suite rollout used viral adoption and an internal leaderboard to reach 200,000 users in 8 months. Shopify concentrated on prototyping as the wedge — one activity that touched every team.

Pilots avoid tipping points. They're designed to be safe, contained, and reversible. That's exactly why they don't tip anything.

The Heath brothers call the opposite approach **"Shrink the Change"** — make the first step so small that the Elephant can't object. "Use AI every day" sounds overwhelming. "Try using AI for one task Tuesday afternoon" sounds manageable. Once people start, momentum takes over. But the shrunk change must be designed to expand, not designed to stay small.

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Name your zombie pilots.** Right now, how many AI "experiments" or "proofs of concept" are running in your organization? How many have been running for more than 3 months? How many have a clear decision point with a date? If there's no kill-or-scale date, it's a zombie.

2. **Apply the pilot-vs-experiment test.** For every current AI initiative, ask: Is this designed to contain or to expand? Is there a decision deadline? Will the results spread to other teams? If the answer to all three is no, kill it and restart as a Tuesday experiment.

3. **Pick one task, one tool, one Tuesday.** This week, pick the simplest possible AI experiment. One task your team does regularly. One AI tool. Tuesday afternoon. Everyone tries it for 30 minutes. Compare results Wednesday morning. If it works, make it the default by Friday. If it doesn't, try a different task next Tuesday.

4. **Make it a rhythm.** The first Tuesday is an experiment. If it works, the second Tuesday is a habit. By the fourth Tuesday, it's just how you work. Schedule a standing "AI Tuesday" for the next 4 weeks.

5. **Follow the BCG 10-20-70 rule.** Allocate resources like AI leaders do: 10% on algorithms, 20% on technology and data, and **70% on people and processes**. If your AI budget is 80% software licenses and 20% training, you've got it backwards.

6. **Celebrate the small wins publicly.** "Our team used AI for meeting summaries Tuesday. We saved 2 hours and got better notes." That's a win. Share it. It's more powerful than any strategy deck.
