## The Story

When Airtable CEO Howie Liu decided to rebuild his company around AI, he didn't tap the most senior engineers or the longest-tenured employees. He **"deputized people across the company to be what we're calling AI ambassadors — a person who's the most savvy at figuring out AI and how to bring it into their department."**

Notice the word: *savvy*. Not senior. Not expert. Not the person who's been here longest. The person who's most savvy at *figuring things out*.

At Shopify, AI exploration is embedded from day one — especially for interns. When VP of Engineering Farhan Thawar mentioned Shopify started with 25 engineering interns, CEO Tobi Lutke asked how big they could scale. The answer: **1,000 interns** — specifically because beginners use AI in the most interesting ways. And when Thawar ordered 1,500 Cursor AI licenses, he quickly had to procure another 1,500. The fastest growing groups? **Not engineering — it's support and revenue teams.** The "non-technical" people turned out to be the most creative AI users.

Shopify also built an **internal leaderboard** that tracks who spends the most on AI tokens — "a cool proxy for value." And Thawar warns other companies against rationing: *"I'm seeing a concerning trend... 'Can I afford an extra $1,000-$10,000 per month per engineer?' So they clamp down on spending."* Clamping down on spending kills adoption.

GitHub Copilot's adoption followed a similar pattern. The initial rollout wasn't to enterprise CIOs. It was to **individual developers**. The company sold directly to the most curious programmers — the ones who tried the beta, told their friends, and created grassroots demand that eventually pulled enterprises into buying licenses. A $2 billion business was built bottom-up, not top-down.

McKinsey's research confirms this pattern: **employees aged 35-44 are the most confident AI adopters** — not the youngest (digital natives) and not the most senior (strategic decision-makers). The middle. The people curious enough to try but experienced enough to apply.

Microsoft's internal Copilot rollout proves the power of this approach at scale. When they deployed Copilot to all employees globally, adoption was driven not by executive mandates but by a **grass-roots community of nearly 10,000 internal Copilot champions** who became, in Microsoft's words, "an incredible force multiplier for global change management." These weren't AI specialists. They were curious employees who figured things out and showed their colleagues.

The Edelman Trust Barometer quantified why peer champions matter more than leadership announcements: **"Someone like me" is 2x more trusted than a CEO or government leader** to tell the truth about AI. When employees hear about AI from a peer who uses it — someone in their department, at their level — they're twice as likely to believe it and try it.

And the shadow AI data tells its own story. Zapier found that employees are 3X more likely to use AI than leaders expect. HBR found that the most successful enterprise AI deployments started with **"prosumers"** — power users who had already experimented with ChatGPT for personal productivity. Who are those shadow users? They're not the people leadership designated as AI champions. They're the people who were curious enough to start on their own.

## The Science

Your AI champions aren't the people you assign. They're the people who already started without being asked. Appreciate that. Amplify it.

**Radical Change theory** (Schabracq) argues that in environments of continuous disruption — which is what AI creates — the traditional expert is at a disadvantage. Experts have invested years in mastering a specific way of doing things. That investment becomes a **sunk cost** that makes them resistant to abandoning their approach. Beginners have no sunk costs. Their openness is their superpower.

## The Move: Monday Morning

1. **Find your shadow AI users.** Run a simple anonymous survey: "Which AI tools are you currently using for work, with or without company approval?" The people who answer honestly are your champions. Crown them.

2. **Create a Pathfinder program.** Identify 5-10 people across departments who are already curious about AI (not necessarily technical). Give them:
   - Time: 2-4 hours per week designated for AI exploration.
   - Tools: Access to approved AI tools and a small budget for experimentation.
   - Visibility: A monthly show-and-tell to share what they've learned with the broader team.
   - No penalties: Make it safe to try and fail.

3. **Invert the mentoring.** In most organizations, senior people mentor junior people. For AI, flip it. Have your most AI-savvy people (regardless of seniority) mentor leaders and managers. Airtable's AI Ambassador model does exactly this — department-level champions who bring AI into their teams from the ground up.
