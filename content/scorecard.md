**Instructions:** Rate your organization 1-5 on each of the 8 rules. Be honest — this is a diagnostic, not a report card.

| # | Rule | Question | Score (1-5) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Find the Emotion | Have we addressed the emotional dimension of AI change? Do we know how our people actually feel? | |
| 2 | Make It Default | Is AI the starting point for key workflows, or an optional add-on? | |
| 3 | Kill the Pilot, Start the Tuesday | Have we moved beyond endless pilots to rapid, expanding experiments? | |
| 4 | Crown the Beginners | Have we identified and empowered our most curious AI users (regardless of seniority)? | |
| 5 | Lead from the Inference Log | Are leaders the most active AI users? Can they demonstrate personal AI usage? | |
| 6 | Map the Losses | Have we acknowledged what people are losing in the AI transition? | |
| 7 | Build the Green Light List | Do people know exactly what AI tools and use cases are approved? | |
| 8 | Never Refreeze | Do we have infrastructure for continuous AI evolution (not a one-time rollout)? | |

**Bonus — Executive Section:**

| | Measure the Shadow | Do we know the real state of AI adoption, including unapproved usage? | |

**Total Score: ___ / 40** (+ Bonus: ___ / 5)

### Scoring Guide

| Score | Level | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| 8-16 | **Beginning** | AI change management hasn't started. You're in the 92% planning but not executing. Start with Rules 1, 7, and 3. |
| 17-24 | **Emerging** | Some awareness, some action, but fragmented. Focus on Rules 5 and the Executive Section to build leadership commitment and measurement. |
| 25-32 | **Developing** | Solid foundation. Multiple rules in motion. Focus on Rules 6 and 8 to deepen and sustain. |
| 33-40 | **Leading** | Comprehensive approach. You're in the 1% delivering real results. Focus on consistency and continuous adaptation. |
